            <p>
                My name is Vincent Nalupta and I am currently a Team Lead at
                Grubhub.
            </p>

            <p>
                I manage a team of engineers that handle everything from design
                systems to JavaScript frameworks.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is my space to design, code and share some thoughts about
                tech and life.
