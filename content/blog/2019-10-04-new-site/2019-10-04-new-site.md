##### Welcome to the new site!

This summer we took a road trip through the Hudson valley up to Montreal, and had a really wonderful vacation. The Hudson valley is full of small farms and hippy cafes and rolling mountains. Montreal in the summer, with it's beautiful colors, vibrant community and incredible food really inspired and awoke the designer in me. This redesign is a collection of so many little and big things that made it's way into my consciousness during that trip.

Rolling into New York Fashion Week, I was noticing a trend of extremely bold colors and accents - from streetwear to the last round of big sneaker drops over the summer. To me this is a great thing! Check out some street looks from this season.

Combining all of this inspiration together, I was able to make a color palette. You can check out the color values and view the palette [at Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/Redesign-color-theme-13425637).

#### Designing
Moving onto my actual design, ultimately I landed on a mix of gradients and hard shapes that would pop some Nike-inspired Volt yellow every now and then. My angle was Nike React shoe - inside of Hipster art on wall cafe - on the way to Montreal in the summer... in a webpage.

I finally got a chance to use this brand new [Wacom Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Wireless-Software-Pistachio-CTL4100WLE0/dp/B079J7DCXN/) that I totally bought on a whim because I've always wanted one. The end result was the hero section on the homepage.

Moving into code, I settled on some technologies that my team was going to start using at work: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [Styled Components](styled-components.com/). I deployed my site seamlessly and easily with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

#### Crowns

I got kind of into crowns after my son, Thierry, was born. His name means "Ruler of the people" in French. There's a play on words there because my name, Vincent, means "Conqueror" in Latin. I have a crown on a tattoo with his name and my wedding ring is also a crown.

I also love that I can accent my dark color plaette with a bright yellow crown. I took inspiration for this from the bright yellow chair (which I love) in my home office.

#### Final Thoughts

I love the site I made. I was able to play with some things to help support my team as well as scratch my designer itch. I promise this time I'm going to write some more and now I have a home to do that. Don't be a stranger!







A few months ago I started playing with some code as a way to get familiar with some of the technologies that my team was going to start using at work: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [Styled Components](styled-components.com/). A couple things happened at the end of this summer that turned the whole "playing with code" into a full on redesign. First, we took a trip to Montreal at the end of the summer where I was so inspired by all of the great design I saw in the city. Second, I bought a [Wacom Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Wireless-Software-Pistachio-CTL4100WLE0/dp/B079J7DCXN/) totally on a whim because I've always wanted one. I took all of that pent up design inspiration from the trip and poured into this new toy that I just bought. The end result eventually became this new site.

#### Process

I haven't designed designed in a long time and honestly I just missed it. This was my chance to finally crank open Sketch and just do the thing that I enjoy without attaching a deadline or an outcome to it. I didn't start in code. I didn't make a design system. I know, I know. I work in design systems every single day so you would think I would start there because that's the right thing to do. But sometimes you just want to open Sketch and start, well, sketching. The cool thing that happened along the way was that in doing the design, a design system kind of opened up around me.

For instance, once I picked a typeface and started wireframing some content, I realized that I would need some headings and that I would have to make a decision about their sizing. I wanted some big, bold type and settled on [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). Then I headed over to [Type Scale](https://type-scale.com) to generate the sizes for me. Interestingly enough, you can generate typescales in a manner similar to musical moods. I chose [Major Third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third) for no good reason other than it was the default choice. Styled components made it easy to apply that globally with [createGlobalStyle](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#createglobalstyle).

#### Sketching

There was a moment when I bought the pen tablet that I kind of thought to myself, Why did I buy this? I could've just borrowed one to see if I could even use it but typical Vince move I just went all in and bought a brand new one. Luckily for me it was love at first... touch? I probably could have just used a mouse for this but having a pen in your hand activates a different part of your brain. I just feel so creative in it.

Personally I've always liked blue. My desk is blue. Fun (weird) fact about me is that I've love watching Mountaineering documentaries on Netflix and Amazon. When I started sketching I wondered if I could throw some blue mountains in there and it just kind of worked as a teaser to more content without being really corny.

In the design I had two mountains skewed on top of each other. I actually laid those out as two different vector paths but when it came time to code them, fetching two separate images that did the same thing didn't make sense. So I just exported one of them as an SVG and [manipulated them to get the effect I wanted](https://github.com/snailbites/snailbites-gatsby/blob/master/src/components/mountainRange.js).

#### The Domain Name

I had no idea that when you don't renew your domain new it's likely gone forever. The hosting company will snatch up your domain and either try to sell it to someone else or [hold it at some absurd price](https://www.namepros.com/threads/held-hostage-by-huge-domains-advice.1023392/) to sell it back to you. There is a whole process behind it that is regulated internationally to avoid this type of behavior. But if you are ignorant, like me, then you would just let your $10 domain expire because anything that's $10 can easily be rebought. Not so.

I had bought snailbites dot com when I was 19. That was almost two decades ago! Two years ago, the second it expired, I saw it listed back up for $1795. I've been checking in every now and then to see if it would drop down. No luck. Last week, before I was about to launch this site, I literally begged them to give it back to me for cheap. I offered $500. They countered at $1695. We went on and on with me begging and them rejecting me until they settled on $1595 with a payment plan. Ya boy Vince over here was still offering \$500 ðŸ˜‚

Distraught but hopeful, I put my creative thinking hat on and ended up buying this domain. It's a Spanish extension. When I registered, they asked for some ID without specifying exactly what number they needed. I did some research and some sites suggested a passport number or a valid driver's license. But which license and which country? When it came time to put that information, there were no specifics, just a field for a number. I wasn't comfortable using my passport so I put in _some_ number and lo and behold, my domain was registered with no problems.
